    "text": "I’ve been using nixpkgs to install things on my $WORK_LAPTOP, as they’re a bit faster to resolve as compared to using apt. nixpkgs also provides more updated packages, generally.\nI installed FiraCodeNerd because I felt like it was time for a change in my terminal, but I couldn’t get fc-cache to pick it up. I’m using nix profile install for this and the installed contents tend to end up somewhere inside $HOME/.nix-profile/.\nI found them in $HOME/.nix-profile/share/fonts. Then, after delving through a few manpages, discovered that I could create a new file in /etc/fonts/local.conf to add a directory for the fc-cache search.\nI had to create /etc/fonts/local.conf as follows:\n&lt;?xml version=\"1.0\"?&gt;\n&lt;!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM \"fonts.dtd\"&gt;\n&lt;fontconfig&gt;\n &lt;dir&gt;/home/gil/.nix-profile/share/fonts/&lt;/dir&gt;\n&lt;/fontconfig&gt;\nAnd it worked!"

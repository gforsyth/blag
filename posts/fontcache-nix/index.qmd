I've been using `nixpkgs` to install things on my `$WORK_LAPTOP`, as they're a
bit faster to resolve as compared to using `apt`. `nixpkgs` also provides more
updated packages, generally.

I installed FiraCodeNerd because I felt like it was time for a change in my
terminal, but I couldn't get `fc-cache` to pick it up. I'm using `nix profile
install` for this and the installed contents tend to end up _somewhere_ inside
`$HOME/.nix-profile/`.

I found them in `$HOME/.nix-profile/share/fonts`. Then, after delving through a
few manpages, discovered that I could create a new file in `/etc/fonts/local.conf`
to add a directory for the `fc-cache` search.

I had to create `/etc/fonts/local.conf` as follows:

```sh
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
 <dir>/home/gil/.nix-profile/share/fonts/</dir>
</fontconfig>
```

And it worked!
